# 🧬 GA-DFS: Genetic Algorithm-Aided Deep Feature Selection for Chest X-Ray Disease Classification

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is about building an intelligent system that classifies **chest X-ray diseases** using deep learning. We explored multiple ANN architectures for **feature extraction** and enhanced model performance using a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** for optimal feature selection.

The dataset used in this project is the [Kaggle Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/xhlulu/vinbigdata-chest-xray-resized-png-256x256/data), which contains X-ray images categorized as normal or showing signs of different respiratory diseases.
This dataset is a subset mini version of the original one [Kaggle Chest X-ray Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection)
The key objective was to identify the most relevant features and eliminate redundancy, resulting in **faster**, **more accurate**, and **efficient** predictions.

## 🤖 Models Explored

We experimented with 4 major CNN-based architectures:
- ✅ **DenseNet121**
- ✅ **VGG16**
- ✅ **ResNet50**
- ✅ **EfficientNetB3**

Out of these, **VGG16** and **DenseNet121** were further combined with a **Genetic Algorithm-based feature selection** approach to create 2 more powerful variants. These variants used an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for classification after GA feature selection, not CNN.

> 🔢 **Total Models Evaluated:** 6  
> 🏆 **Best Performer:** `DenseNet + GA`

Detailed metrics and evaluation visuals are available in the `results/` folder.

## 🧬 Genetic Algorithm Integration

- We used GA to **select the most relevant features** from the deep features extracted by CNNs.
- These selected features were passed through a lightweight **ANN-based classifier** for final disease prediction.
- This approach significantly improved the model's interpretability and reduced computational complexity.
